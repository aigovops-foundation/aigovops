# AiGovOps v4 — Milestones

The full build, milestone by milestone. Every one was tested, shipped to `main`, and verified
(CI + Pages green). End state: **28 workspaces · 188 tests · zero runtime dependencies · MIT · public**.

## Phase 0 — Foundation
| | What shipped |
|---|---|
| **Bootstrap** | the public repo created from a corrected install script; the three products (Beacon · Lantern · Umbrella) made real, orchestrated by Jeeves |
| **Blueprint** | the v4.0 product blueprint synthesized from public AI-governance law + a verified Apache-2.0 / 10k★ open-source stack (`docs/BLUEPRINT.md`) |

## Phase 1 — The governance kernel (M0–M5)
| | Milestone | What shipped |
|---|---|---|
| **M0** | Unify the gate | one `@aigovops/gate.decide()`: Umbrella criteria → Lantern drift → Caps → human decision → Beacon receipt → Secrets broker (replaced 3 divergent gates) |
| **M1** | Policy-Improver | `@aigovops/corpus` (cited regulatory requirements) + `policy-improver`: written policy → coverage + cited gaps |
| **M2** | Gate-Author + side-by-side | gaps → runnable Umbrella gates with Get/Stay/Recover exit states; governed-vs-ungoverned comparison |
| **M3** | Install + Control Room | tier-detecting onboarding (`install`) + role-scoped oversight dashboard (`control-room`) |
| **M4** | Heavyweight adapters | one contract, swappable backends: OPA · Prometheus · Keycloak · OpenSearch · Kong (timeout/retry/health) |
| **M5** | Tier-1 agents + scheduler | regulation-watch · compliance-attestor · audit-bundler; zero-dep cron + Airflow/GitHub-Actions exporters |
| **—** | Conversational Jeeves | offline `HeuristicLLM` + real `AnthropicLLM` (claude-opus-4-8, raw fetch); grounded conversational policy-improver; Jeeves as agent + site manager |

## Phase 2 — Products v-next + platform (M6–M9)
| | Milestone | What shipped |
|---|---|---|
| **M6** | Beacon v-next | hash-chained tamper-evident ledger · key rotation · in-toto/SLSA **DSSE attestation** (cosign-interoperable) · MLflow model signing |
| **M7** | Lantern v-next | statistical drift (**PSI / KL / K-S**) · Great-Expectations-style data-quality gates · continuous monitor + Alertmanager routing · Jaeger trace adapter |
| **M8** | Umbrella v-next | **framework profiles** (corpus → runnable per-regulation policy) · Casbin RBAC · Kyverno emitter · policy lifecycle (version/simulate/canary) · Trivy/ZAP/Semgrep gates |
| **M9** | Platform | **gate-as-a-service** HTTP API + `GateClient` SDK · persistence (`store`) · OS-level **sandbox** emitters (seccomp/nftables/gVisor) · **conformance** suite · Docker + Helm · the **Studio** developer console |

## Phase 3 — Productization (M10–M15)
| | Milestone | What shipped |
|---|---|---|
| **M10** | One-command install | `aigovops up` (tier→Compose generator + Caddy auto-HTTPS) · `curl \| sh` installer · falls back to the zero-dep node runtime |
| **M11** | The Wizard | warm, **Intuit-grade**, no-code setup at `/` → cited gaps → Jeeves authors gates → a **signed Compliance Certificate** (+ confetti) |
| **M12** | Jeeves agent-run installer | the irreversibility boundary as a state machine: auto-runs reversible steps, **pauses at every human gate** (provision · account · DNS · go-live); `aigovops setup` |
| **M13** | Install everywhere | `aigovops deploy render\|fly\|do\|cloud-init` · polished Helm chart (ingress/NOTES) · **Tauri** desktop scaffold |
| **M14** | Polished consoles | `@aigovops/tokens` design system · `/v1/metrics` (Prometheus) · Backstage · Superset · Appsmith integration descriptors |
| **M15** | Hosted open-core SaaS | `@aigovops/{plans,tenancy,billing}` · `/pricing` · per-tenant quotas + Stripe — funds the Foundation, **self-host stays unlimited & free** |

## Phase 4 — Depth
| | Milestone | What shipped |
|---|---|---|
| **M16** | Evidence vault & DSAR | every signed decision appended to a per-tenant, **hash-chained** Beacon ledger in the live gate; role-scoped query (`/v1/evidence`), chain verify, and a **signed audit / DSAR bundle** (`/v1/evidence/bundle`); surfaced in the Studio |
| **M17** | Depth — secrets · observability · SDK · release | real **Vault/OpenBao** secrets backend (async broker) · **OTLP** self-observability (`/v1/traces` → OTel Collector/Jaeger) · a **Python SDK** that passes cross-language conformance against a live gate · **GHCR image + release** automation (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) + `CHANGELOG.md` |
| **M18** | Close the last module gaps | authored gates → **real OPA Rego** (`toRego`) · Beacon **Fluentd** log-shipping (metadata-only) · Lantern **`DriftHistory`** (per-field series + stability) · a **Grafana dashboard** for `/v1/metrics`. Every ROADMAP ◻️ is now closed |
| **M19** | The Ops agent (Jeeves-managed) | `@aigovops/ops-agent` — the remaining **ops** work (publish · observability · provision · deploy · desktop · billing · npm · DNS · go-live) as a state machine that **auto-runs everything reversible and stops at every irreversible human gate**. Registered as a Jeeves sub-agent (`ops-runner`); `aigovops-ops` CLI. The irreversibility boundary, applied to ops |
| **M20** | Agent-driven runbook + 1Password | `OpsRunbook` resolves every credential from **1Password** (`OnePasswordProvider`, Connect API) **through the governed broker** (scoped, expiring, single-use grants). Credential-entry is no longer manual — a secret is stored once, read every run. The ship runbook drops from **7 human gates → 4** (only the irreversible/outward ones). The system rule: automate all you can, very little manual. See [RUNBOOK.md](./RUNBOOK.md) |
| **M21** | The served Approvals console | `GET /approvals` — a delightful, dark, step-by-step approval surface backed by a **live `OpsAgent`** (`/v1/ops/state` · `/v1/ops/approve` · `/v1/ops/reset`). Real Approve buttons advance the real runbook; the agent auto-runs reversible steps between gates; 1Password credential chips; a go-live finish. Verified end-to-end in the browser |
| **M22** | Ready-for-Human gates | The agent does **all the engineering for every step** ahead of time (`prepareStep`): the exact command, the prefilled config, the deep-link, the computed values — backed by real committed artifacts (`deploy/provision/cloud-init.yaml`, `deploy/scripts/deploy.sh`, `sign-desktop.sh`, `stripe/env.template`). Auto steps are directly executable; each human gate arrives **fully staged** (open-the-exact-page link, prepared A-record, go-live preflight). The console shows a `READY` badge on every step. Nothing left to prepare — only the irreversible decision |

## Phase 5 — Revive & deploy
| | Milestone | What shipped |
|---|---|---|
| **M23** | One-click Studio deploy | The revived core is **deployable to a public, non-production URL in one click**. Root **`render.yaml`** (Render Blueprint, auto-detected) + root **`fly.toml`**, corrected to **`AIGOVOPS_TIER=1`** (the zero-dependency gate/Studio in one container, not the tier-4 sidecar stack) + **`DEPLOY-STUDIO.md`** runbook. The gate-service serves `/` (wizard), `/studio` (developer console), `/v1/decide`; the image builds host-side (no local Docker). Reversible spine verified on `revive/2026-08-anoint`: current-Node parity (193/193), the frozen one-receipt-format contract (`schema/receipt.schema.json`), publish-readiness (28/28), README honesty. Deploy + publish + Omni cutover remain **founder gates**. See [REVIVE.md](../REVIVE.md) · [DEPLOY-STUDIO.md](../DEPLOY-STUDIO.md) |
